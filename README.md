# cpp_design_patterns
This repo contains some simple example of c++ design patterns.

There are following design paterns:
1. adapter_1

## adapter_1 
This is a common design pattern which is used in cases that interface of some class should be adapt to different interface.

2. bridge_1

## bridge_1 
Bridge design pattern  is commonly ised in case of decoupling class on to separate classes one for abstraction(interface according outter world) and second one for implementation. On this way both classes become independed for further development. Also to note that on that way compile time can be saved.
